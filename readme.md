### HTML -> SCORM
This will be a small program that wraps a html project into SCORM e-learning format.
It generates a imsmanifest file for SCORM 1.2.

# Terminal syntax
It will be posible to execute the "htmlscorm" command from the root of the html project. 
The imsmanifest.xml file is then saved in the project folder.

- htmlscorm <projectname> <projecttitle>
